# Cybersecurity Home Lab

## Highlights
This is my first fully documented cybersecurity home lab, built from scratch using Oracle VirtualBox.  
It demonstrates that I can install and configure virtual machines, set up isolated networking, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and perform basic reconnaissance scans with nmap.  

By combining **daily notes**, **polished lab reports**, **guides**, and **troubleshooting logs**, this repo shows not only what I accomplished but also **how I learned, solved problems, and documented professionally**.  
It is designed to be both a **learning project** and a **portfolio piece** for college applications, internships, and future cybersecurity roles.  

---

## Purpose
- Provide a **safe, isolated environment** to practice IT and cybersecurity techniques.  
- Support preparation for certifications like **CompTIA ITF+, A+, Security+**, and the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**.  
- Build an evidence-based portfolio with **screenshots, labs, and troubleshooting logs**.  

---

## Repo Structure
- `/Notes/` ‚Äî Day-by-day notes (raw learning logs).  
- `/Labs/` ‚Äî Polished reports (formal write-ups with objectives, steps, outcomes).  
- `/Guides/` ‚Äî How-to documentation (repeatable instructions, e.g. snapshots).  
- `/Screenshots/` ‚Äî Evidence files (all PNGs with action + date in filename).  
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project overview + portfolio summary.  
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` ‚Äî Symptom ‚Üí Cause ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Evidence (dated).

### ‚úÖ Day 4 ‚Äì Repo Structure & Docs (2025-09-11)
- Added `/Labs` and `/Guides` folders  
- Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and `RESOURCES.md`  
- Logged first troubleshooting entries  

---

### ‚úÖ Day 5a ‚Äì Host-Only Adapter Setup (2025-09-15)
- Installed VirtualBox Extension Pack  
- Created Host-Only Adapter in Network Manager  
- Configured Adapter 2 = Host-Only on both VMs

### ‚úÖ Day 5b ‚Äì VM Connectivity Test (2025-09-16)
- Found Windows Host-Only IP with `ipconfig`  
- Kali ‚Üí Windows ping initially failed (ICMP blocked)  
- Enabled Windows Firewall inbound ICMP rule  
- Retested ‚Üí ping successful

## Troubleshooting Highlights
Examples of issues solved:  
- Windows 10 OOBE forced Microsoft account ‚Üí bypassed with `OOBE\BYPASSNRO`  
- Kali Linux ‚ÄúNo disk drive found‚Äù ‚Üí fixed by adding a virtual hard disk  
- Missing Host-Only Adapter option ‚Üí fixed by creating adapter in VirtualBox Network Manager  
- Kali ‚Üí Windows ping failed ‚Üí fixed by enabling Windows Firewall ICMP rule  
- Nmap service scan showed all ports filtered ‚Üí explained by Windows Firewall defaults

## Next Steps
- Add a third VM (Ubuntu server or Metasploitable) for advanced labs  
- Document TryHackMe practice labs in a separate repo  
- Begin certification-focused repos (CompTIA ITF+, A+)
