# Day 5b ‚Äì VM Network Connectivity Test (2025-09-15)

## Goal
Verify that the Windows 10 and Kali Linux VMs can communicate over the Host-Only network.  
This confirms both network configuration and firewall rules are correctly set.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Found Windows Host-Only IP
- Booted into the **Windows 10 VM**.  
- Opened **Command Prompt** ‚Üí ran:

    ipconfig

- Found Host-only Adapter IP in the range `192.168.56.x`.

### 2. Initial Ping Test (Kali ‚Üí Windows)
- Booted into the **Kali Linux VM**.  
- Opened a terminal and ran:

    ping -c 4 192.168.56.101

- ‚ùå Result: Ping failed (`Destination Host Unreachable`).
